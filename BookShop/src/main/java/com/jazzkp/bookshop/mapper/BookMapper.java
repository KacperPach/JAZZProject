        sometimes mapstruct needs to be reminded
        that "id" indeed maps to "id", otherwise
        it will generate a mapper that just creates
        a new object with all children set to null.
        after a couple of compiles it may just
        start remembering that the line telling it
        to map id to id is stupid and should not be
        there and throw a compile error.
        this is why you my see this line commented
        out or not depending on how mapstruct is
        feeling rn. ðŸ¤“
        I GET IT NOW IT THINKS ITS NULL WHEN I
        MVN CLEAN INSTALL BECAUSE THE OBJECTS
        FROM OPENAPI GENERATE AT THE
        SAME TIME/AFTER THIS CLASS BUILDS SO
        IT ACTUALLY THINKS THE OBJECTS DON'T
        HAVE IDS ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ (maybe)
